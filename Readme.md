Requirements
- Istio deploymet model: Multi Primary multi cluster single mesh with different networks
- We need two clusters with load balance installed
- Istio can be or not installed on both clusters. The scripts will install Istio anyways.
- First you need to change the root CA since this is a multi primary multi cluster
